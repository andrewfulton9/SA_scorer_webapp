<h3> Welcome to SA Scorer! </h3>

<p> SA Scorer is a web application built for the purpose of scoring raw
    data collected from spontaneous alternation using a 4-armed plus
    maze. The goal of this app is to streamline and eliminate human
    error in scoring.
</p>
<p> Begin by downloading the template below where you will input your raw data.
    If you need to see an example of how data should be filled in, download the
    example file below.
    Once your raw data is filled in, click on the upload file link
     <a href="{{url_for('upload')}}">here</a>
    or above in the header. Next upload your completed file and choose
    whether you would like to score the data from the full 18
    minutes, the first 6 minutes or the first 12 minutes and press
    submit and a table of scored data will be returned to you, which
    you can then download as a csv
